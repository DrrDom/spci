# SPCI

Automatic tool for mining structure-property relationships from chemical data sets

#### Description

Retrieves structure-property relationship from data sets in a chemically meaningful way.  
Returns estimated contributions of fragments to the investigated property of compounds from a data set and can estimate contribution of different physicochemical factors as well.

#### Installation

`pip install spci`

#### Features

1. Easy to use straightforward workflow with GUI.
2. Automatic model building and cross-validation.
3. Build models for imbalanced data set using the multiple oversampling approach.
4. Prediction with built models.
5. Several fragmentation schemes to compute fragment contributions of:
  - common functional groups and rings;  
  - Murcko scaffolds;  
  - user-defined fragments;  
  - automatically generated fragments (based on SMARTS pattern matching broken bonds);  
  - per atom fragmentation.

#### Visualization and analysis of results

1. Built-in visualization.
2. rspci - R package for custom visualization and analysis (https://github.com/DrrDom/rspci)
3. Online tool for visualization, plot customization and figure downloading (http://158.194.101.252:3838/spci-vis/). Demo version is here (http://158.194.101.252:3838/spci-vis-demo/)
4. Per atom contributions can be visualized with RDKit similarity maps.
