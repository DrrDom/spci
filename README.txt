Tool for mining structure-property relationships from chemical datasets

Detailed description
-----
Retrieves structure-property relationship from datasets in a chemically meaningful way.
Returns estimated contributions of fragments to the investigated property of compounds from a dataset and can estimate contribution of different physico-chemical factors as well.
Partial description was given in the paper http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/minf.201300029
New paper describing more details is in preparation.

Features
-----
1. Easy to use straightforward workflow with GUI.
2. Several fragmentation schemes to analyze contributions of:
  a) all rings;
  b) Murcko scaffolds;
  c) common functional groups and rings;
  d) user-defined fragments.

Manual
-----
Short manual is included.

Visualization of results
-----
1. Built-in visualization.
2. External tool for nice visualization, plot customization and figure downloading - https://pavel.shinyapps.io/sirms-qsar-vis/
